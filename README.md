# Calculator


The enhanced calculation display is an added section below the calculator's main interface that provides a larger and more distinct area for showcasing the ongoing calculation. This section is designed to draw the user's attention to the current operation being performed and the result. It's presented in a square bar format, ensuring clarity and visibility, even for longer calculations.

## Functionality



**Description:**
The Enhanced Mobile Calculation Display is an innovative addition designed to optimize the visibility of ongoing calculations and results within your calculator app. This feature is particularly tailored for users who predominantly access the app through mobile devices, specifically from iPhone 6 and newer models. Given the mobile-first design approach, this feature aligns seamlessly with responsive design principles, ensuring clarity and usability across a range of screen sizes.


1. **Dynamic Operation Showcase:** The Enhanced Mobile Calculation Display resides beneath the primary calculator interface, providing a dedicated square bar space. It dynamically highlights the ongoing calculation in a clear and prominent manner. For instance, as users input numbers and operators like "5 + 3 * 2," the display showcases "5 + 3 * 2."

2. **Real-time Updates:** As users input numbers and operators, the calculation display updates in real time. This empowers users to follow the calculation's progression step by step, reducing potential errors.

3. **Prominent Result Presentation:** Upon tapping the "=" button for calculation, the final result takes center stage in the calculation display. For example, if the calculation was "5 + 3 * 2 = 11," the display will confidently show "5 + 3 * 2 = 11."

**Visual Enrichment:**
To ensure distinction from the main interface, the Enhanced Mobile Calculation Display features:
- A distinctive background color.
- Amplified font size for enhanced readability.
- Bold typography to establish visual hierarchy and emphasis.

**User Interaction:**
Users seamlessly interact with the Enhanced Mobile Calculation Display:
- If a user identifies an input error, they can directly edit the calculation by tapping on the relevant portion of the display.
- Resetting the calculator or initiating a new calculation resets the calculation display to its default state.

**Benefits:**
- Elevates calculation visibility, reducing potential confusion and errors.
- Elevates user experience by offering an engaging, interactive calculation process.
- Tailored for mobile screens, capitalizing on mobile-first design principles for a coherent user experience.


## Roadmap
